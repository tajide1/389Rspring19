## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (70 Pts)

### Part 2 (30 Pts)
1.CBC is faster than ECB in copying files
2.CBC is more secure than ECB ecryption. For example let a and b be the same plaintext in different block and will be encrypted with the same key. Using ECB will use the same cipertext for a and b, which could allow hackers to easily gain access.
With CBC ciphertext of a will be different from ciphertext of b, which makes it difficult for hackers.
